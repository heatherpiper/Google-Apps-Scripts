# Google Apps Scripts

My personal Google Apps Scripts I've written to save time and headaches.

## Adjacent Cell Background Fill

This script is handy when you have a table of color code values but want to be able to represent those colors visually. I use this when modifying or developing color themes.

This demonstration uses colors from REI's design system, [Cedar](https://cedar.rei.com/).
